# Colour Sorter
Colour Sorting is the processing of separating the object or materials based on the colour. It can be done easily by looking through it, but it is a repetitive task, and for larger quantity it must be boring. Colour Based Object Sorting has a wide usage in fruit sorting as well as candy sorting industries. It is Used in the Fruit industries to detect the condition of the Fruit based on the colour. We use the Colour Detector sensor with the Arduino to detect the sensor that detects the colour and turn the conveyor to the corresponding bin placed in the end of the Conveyor.
